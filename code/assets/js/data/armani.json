The Orange blossom note is extracted in Egypt using an innovative, exclusive and entirely natural enfleurage process, whose cold extraction method infuses the Orange flowers in Orange essence. The artisanal approach finally translates in the manual weighing and blending of the fragrance\u2019s concentrate in Grasse creates pure, highly-refined notes with enhanced radiance and naturality.
